# DungeonScrawlImporter

Foundry module to allow importing a .ds file generated with Dungeon Scrawl to automatically generate walls.

The following features / bugs are known:
* Detection of doors is not implemented
* Overlapping Walls block of passages they shouldn't
* The number of Walls is rather high, it is recommended to install [Merge Walls](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/mergewalls) and use it to reduce the wall count

### Ko-Fi

If you have read this far and want to show some more appreciation: I have a Ko-Fi, should you consider what I'm doing worth a little something. Of course I do not expect nor require anyone to use it, but I'll leave it here in case someone wants to give:
